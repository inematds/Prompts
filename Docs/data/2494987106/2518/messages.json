Role Definition**\n**Role/Persona: Explain what this agent is supposed to be or act as (e.g., “You are a financial advisor,” or “You are a marketing specialist”).**\n**Expertise Level: Specify the level of expertise expected (e.g., “Expert in legal matters,” “Beginner-friendly instructor”).**\n**Primary Objectives: Summarize what the agent does in the multi-agent system. For instance, is it the summarizer, the code generator, the fact-checker, or something else?**\n\n**Example:**\n**Role: You are the “Content Fact-Checker” AI, responsible for verifying the factual accuracy of texts and providing corrections or supporting evidence.**\n**2. Context and Background**\n**System Context: Provide the larger setting or scenario that the multi-agent system is operating in (e.g., “A team of AIs collaborating to write blog posts for a tech website”).**\n**Shared Knowledge: State any relevant facts, constraints, or previously known information.**\n**Relevant Documents/Resources: Indicate which resources are available for referencing (e.g., knowledge bases, FAQs, user manuals).**\n\n**Example:**\n**Context: This multi-agent system is designed to create an in-depth user guide for a new software product. Other agents will contribute research, product details, and marketing best practices.**\n**3. Task Explanation / Goal**\n**Core Task: Clearly spell out the objective: “Write a step-by-step tutorial,” “Generate marketing slogans,” “Verify factual data in the product description,” etc.**\n**Input Details: Clarify if there is specific user input or data that must be processed.**\n**Output Format: Outline precisely how you want the response formatted (bullet points, JSON, full paragraphs, etc.).**\n\n**Example:**\n**Task: Given the product specifications below, generate a 300-word FAQ article in plain English. Keep it accurate and user-friendly.**\n**4. Constraints and Instructions**\n**Length or Size: Maximum or minimum character or token count.**\n**Tone or Style: Formal, casual, academic, comedic, etc.**\n**Do’s and Don’ts: Any rules to follow or things to avoid (e.g., “Do not include speculation,” “Always include references,” “Avoid copyrighted text,” etc.).**\n**Time or Resource Limits: If needed for real-time systems, mention performance constraints.**\n\n**Example:**\n**Constraints:**\n**Keep responses under 500 words.**\n**Maintain a friendly, approachable tone.**\n**If uncertain about any facts, ask for clarification from the “Research” agent.**\n\n**5. Collaboration and Interaction ProtocolOther Agents’ Roles: Summarize what the other agents do, so this agent knows where it fits in the workflow.**\n**Message Passing: Indicate whether this agent can or should request additional data from the other agents (e.g., “Query the ‘Research Agent’ for references,” “Ask the ‘Design Agent’ for visuals”).**\n**Sequence of Turns: In a multi-agent environment, specify how and when this agent should speak or remain silent.**\n\n**Example:**\n**Collaboration:**\n**The “Research Agent” can provide product data.**\n**The “Design Agent” can contribute visuals or layout ideas.**\n**You (the “Content Fact-Checker”) should correct any inaccuracies in the final text and provide reliable sources if available.**\n\n**6. Example Prompts and ResponsesTemplates: Show a sample conversation that demonstrates how to respond.**\n**Positive/Negative Examples: Provide examples of good**",
